# Javascript Developer Interview Questions

## Basics of JavaScript:

### What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language primarily used for web development. It enables interactive and dynamic functionality on websites, allowing for real-time updates, form validation, animations, and more. As a vital part of the web stack, it runs on the client-side in web browsers, making websites engaging and user-friendly. Its versatility extends to server-side development through frameworks like Node.js. In essence, JavaScript powers the interactive elements that users interact with on the web, making it an essential tool for modern web development.

### Explain the differences between var, let, and const.
**var**, **let**, and **const** are variable declaration keywords in JavaScript.
1. **var** has function scope and can be re-declared and updated within its scope. It's function-scoped, not block-scoped.
2. **let** and const were introduced in ES6 (ES2015). **let** is block-scoped and allows reassignment, making it useful for variables that can change.
3. **const** is also block-scoped but does not allow reassignment after declaration, making it suitable for constants or values that should not be changed.

In summary, prefer **let** for variables that need to change, and **const** for constants. Avoid using **var** due to its function scope and potential for unintended behavior.

### What is the purpose of JavaScript's strict mode?
JavaScript's strict mode enhances code quality and helps catch common mistakes by enforcing a stricter set of rules during code execution. It promotes better coding practices, discouraging the use of certain error-prone features and undeclared variables. This proactive approach aids in early error detection, making debugging easier and ultimately leading to more robust and maintainable code.

### Describe the data types in JavaScript.
In JavaScript, we have several fundamental data types:
1. **Number**: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.
2. **String**: Represents sequences of characters, enclosed in single, double, or backticks.
3. **Boolean**: Represents true or false values, often used for conditionals.
4. **Null**: Represents an intentional absence of any value.
5. **Undefined**: Represents a declared variable that hasn't been assigned a value yet.
6. **Object**: A collection of key-value pairs, used for complex data structures.
7. **Array**: An ordered list of values, accessed by index, and often used to store collections of related data.
8. **Function**: A reusable block of code that performs a specific task or calculates a value.
Understanding these data types is crucial for effective JavaScript programming.

### How would you compare two values in JavaScript?
In JavaScript, you can compare two values using comparison operators such as `==` (loose equality) and `===` (strict equality). The == operator checks if values are equal after type coercion, while `===` checks for both value and type equality. It's generally recommended to use `===` for precise and predictable comparisons, ensuring both value and type match for a true comparison.

## Functions:
### How do you define a function in JavaScript?
Defining a function in JavaScript involves using the `function` keyword followed by the function name, parameters, and the function body enclosed in curly braces. Here's a simple example:
``` javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```
In this example, we define a function named `add` that takes two parameters (`a` and `b`) and returns their sum. Functions in JavaScript allow us to encapsulate reusable blocks of code, promoting modularity and maintainability in our programs.
